# Design System: TG Web — Signal Floor

**Product:** TG-web — multi-market AI equity research for individual investors  
**Skill:** stitch-design-taste  
**Locked style:** **D · Signal Floor** (see alternatives in [`DESIGN_OPTIONS.md`](./DESIGN_OPTIONS.md))  
**Implementation:** Tokens landed in `src/frontend/styles/globals.css` (dark-first default). Stitch mocks in `docs/stitch-signal-floor/`.  
**Intent:** Abandon the soft gallery-SaaS look. Ship a near-black, high-density market-floor instrument — finance-first at a glance, research-only (never order tickets).

## Configuration — Style Dials

| Dial | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Creativity** | `6` | Distinctive instrument chrome; still trustworthy for money-adjacent UX. |
| **Density** | `8` | Cockpit-dense: quotes, sparks, tasks, credits share the viewport without airy voids. |
| **Variance** | `5` | Stable shell; content may split asymmetrically (composer + pipeline, report + TOC). |
| **Motion Intent** | `6` | Live floor pulse — progress shimmer, running dots, tick updates. Never cinematic fluff. |

> **How to use:** Feed this entire document to Google Stitch as the single visual source of truth. Default chrome is near-black; light **Cool Paper** is reserved for long-form report reading.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

TG Web should feel like a **market floor research pit** — carbon panels, wire-thin rules, amber as the only “go / live / focus” pulse. Rise and Fall carry direction; amber means attention and action.

Atmosphere keywords: **carbon, wireframe precision, live signal, dense ledger, instrument gravity**.

- Density Level 8: compact type, tight row heights, tables over cards, minimal decorative whitespace.
- Variance Level 5: nav predictable; workspaces may be uneven 2-pane splits.
- Motion Level 6: perpetual micro-loops on running jobs and live quotes — opacity/transform only.

Emotional target: *"I'm on the floor; this product is an instrument."*

Brand presence: **TG** / **TradingAgents** is a primary lockup in the sidebar and report header — must pass the remove-the-nav brand test on marketing surfaces.

Not this: Notion-soft mint, purple AI glow, private-bank brass luxury, retail BUY/SELL casino UI.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

One cool carbon-neutral system. Do not mix warm cream with cool slate.

### Core neutrals (product chrome — default)

- **Floor Carbon** (#070A0E) — Primary app canvas. Near-black with blue undertone — never pure `#000000`
- **Pit Panel** (#0E141B) — Sidebar, sticky headers, elevated chrome
- **Pit Surface** (#151C25) — Cards, dialogs, popovers, input wells
- **Wire Edge** (rgba(148,163,184,0.16)) — 1px borders, table rules, section dividers
- **Hot Ink** (#F1F5F9) — Primary text on dark surfaces
- **Dim Meta** (#78879B) — Secondary copy, labels, helper text
- **Ghost Meta** (#5B6B7F) — Timestamps, data-source footnotes, disabled chrome

### Light reading surface (reports only)

- **Cool Paper / Light** — Canvas `#FFFFFF`; panels `#F4F6F9`. Borders ≥18% ink; Dim Meta `#3F4B5B` for secondary text contrast.
- **Report Ink** (#0F172A) — Body text on paper
- **Report Quiet** (#475569) — Secondary report metadata

### Single accent (ONE — do not add a second brand accent)

- **Signal Amber** (#D97706) — Primary CTAs, focus rings, active nav, selected chips, “running / live” emphasis  
  Soft wash: **Amber Wash** `rgba(217,119,6,0.14)`  
  Saturation under 80%. No outer glow. No gradient button fills.  
  Note: Amber is brand *and* caution language — use intensity carefully: solid for CTA, wash for selected/live, never paint entire screens amber.

### Semantic market colors (NOT brand accents — data only)

- **Market Rise** (#22C55E) — Positive change (default green-up for multi-market mockups)
- **Market Rise Soft** (rgba(34,197,94,0.14))
- **Market Fall** (#F43F5E) — Negative change
- **Market Fall Soft** (rgba(244,63,94,0.14))
- **Market Flat** (#94A3B8) — Unchanged

> **Locale note:** Store semantics as Rise/Fall/Flat. CN adapters may invert display mapping. Stitch mocks use Rise green / Fall rose by default.

### Status & risk (supporting)

- **Critical Rose** (#F43F5E) — Errors, failed jobs, destructive confirms (aligns with Fall family)
- **Info Steel** (#38BDF8) — Informational callouts only — never primary CTA
- Do **not** invent a second amber for warnings — reuse Signal Amber wash + Dim Meta copy for stale data / low credits

### Banned colors

- AI Purple / violet neon (`#7C3AED`, indigo glow stacks)
- Pure black `#000000`
- Warm cream `#F4F1EA` + terracotta pairs
- Signal Teal as brand (that was Style A — locked out)
- Brass/gold luxury stacks (Style B)
- Oversaturated neon lime or electric cyan
- Mixed warm/cool gray systems on one screen

## 3. Typography Rules

Density 8 mandate: **all numbers are monospace** — prices, percents, credits, timestamps, IDs, quantities.

- **Display / UI headings:** `Geist` — track-tight (`-0.02em`), weight 600–700. In-app page titles ~`18–22px`. Hierarchy via weight and color.
- **Body / UI:** `Geist` weight 400–500 — root / body **`14px`**, leading `1.45–1.55`. Prose blocks max ~65ch.
- **Mono:** `Geist Mono` — tabular figures. Tables `11–13px`; hero quote price ~`22–28px`.
- **Report long-form:** `Geist` `1.0625rem`, leading `1.65–1.7` on Cool Paper. Section titles weight 600. No prestige serif.

### Type behaviors

- Tickers: mono, slight tracking (`0.04em`), always with exchange badge
- Moves: mono + Rise/Fall + explicit sign (`+1.24%` / `-0.86%`) — no fake `99.99%`
- Credits: mono numerals + Dim Meta label; low balance → Amber Wash chip + Signal Amber text

### Banned fonts

- `Inter`
- Generic serifs (`Georgia`, `Times New Roman`, `Garamond`, `Palatino`)
- Soft rounded display fonts that read as consumer SaaS

## 4. Component Stylings

### Buttons

- Primary: Signal Amber fill (`#D97706`), text `#0C0A09` or `#070A0E` (high contrast on amber). Radius `0` (rectangular). No glow. Hover: slightly lighter amber. Active: `translateY(1px)` + `scale(0.98)`.
- Secondary: transparent + Wire Edge, Hot Ink text. Hover: Pit Surface fill.
- Destructive: Critical Rose outline or soft fill — never amber.
- Disabled: Ghost Meta, no strong fill.
- Max **one** primary CTA per task region (e.g. “Run analysis”).

### Cards & panels

- Prefer **flat pit surfaces** and ruled rows over floating soft cards.
- Radius `0` — rectangular instrument chrome (no soft corners).
- Fill: Pit Surface on Floor Carbon. Border: Wire Edge. Shadow: deep carbon (`0 10px 28px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.55)`), minimal — elevation is rare.
- Lists (tasks, watchlists, admin, ledgers): **no cards** — hairline rows, optional zebra `rgba(148,163,184,0.04)`, row height ~40–44px.

### Inputs & forms

- Label above; helper Dim Meta; error Critical Rose below.
- Wells: recessed Floor Carbon / Pit Panel, Wire Edge, focus ring `2px` Signal Amber at ~40% opacity.
- Ticker search: mono typed codes; results = company (sans) + symbol/exchange (mono).
- Analyst chips: selected = Amber Wash + amber text — not oversized filled pills.

### Data display (industry signature)

- **Quote strip:** large mono last price + Rise/Fall delta + exchange + source + as-of (Ghost Meta). Always freshness — never unscoped “realtime”.
- **In-row mini spark:** dim steel stroke; optional Rise/Fall end segment. No neon area fills.
- **Credit chip:** compact ledger plate — mono remaining, muted cycle end.
- **Job progress:** dense step rail or thin bar with amber shimmer when running; amber pulse dot on “running”. No hero circular spinner.

### Navigation & shell

- Desktop left sidebar: Pit Panel, tight item spacing, brand lockup top, admin block separated by Wire Edge.
- Top bar: compact page title + utilities (language, account). No pill-stat clutter.
- Mobile: single column + sheet menu; touch targets ≥ 44px.

### Loaders, empty, error

- Skeleton shimmer in carbon/steel matching exact layout — quote, table, report outline.
- Empty: factual headline + one action. No emoji.
- Error: inline alert, Critical Rose left rule, recovery CTA.

### Report surfaces

- Flip main canvas to Cool Paper for reading; chrome may stay dark.
- Sticky header: ticker mono + decision badge.
- TOC as left rail or compact tabs — not equal card walls.
- Risk disclaimer: persistent quiet footer (Dim Meta) — visible, not screaming.

---

## 5. Hero & First Impression (marketing / signed-out)

- Asymmetric split: brand + one headline + one sentence + one amber CTA; opposite side = live floor composition (quote strip, dense watchlist fragment, agent pipeline).
- Brand name hero-level.
- Optional inline type-height chart glyph between words (Creativity 6) — no overlapping layers.
- Banned: centered SaaS hero, scroll arrows, 3 equal feature cards as first content, promo stickers on imagery.
- Authenticated home is a **working pit**, not a marketing hero: composer + quote strip dominant; tasks/reports flank densely.

---

## 6. Layout Principles

- Shell: CSS Grid `sidebar | main`. Main gaps `0.75rem–1.25rem` (density 8).
- Workspaces: 2-pane `minmax(0, 1.15fr) minmax(0, 0.85fr)` — avoid 3 equal card columns.
- App containment `max-width: 1440px`; report prose `max-width: 48rem`.
- `min-height: 100dvh` — never `100vh`.
- No overlapping content stacks.
- Tables over cards for tasks, users, audit, credits.
- Admin overview = tight metric pit / uneven bento (2fr / 1fr) — each tile one job, amber accent only on interactive/live bits.

---

## 7. Responsive Rules

Hard requirement: **375 / 768 / 1440**.

- `<768px`: stack all splits; sidebar → sheet; quote stacks price above meta.
- No page-level horizontal scroll; tables may scroll internally with sticky ticker column.
- `clamp()` titles; body ≥ `1rem` on mobile.
- Vertical rhythm: `clamp(0.75rem, 2vw, 1.25rem)` in-app.

---

## 8. Motion & Interaction

Spring default: **stiffness 140, damping 22** — snappier floor feel.

- List enter: opacity + `translateY(4px)`, 30–50ms stagger.
- Quote tick: crossfade / subtle y-nudge — no bounce.
- Running job: amber shimmer on rail + infinite opacity pulse on status dot.
- Hover: border brighten / surface lift — never neon glow or scale pop.
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Optional film grain on Floor Carbon ≤ 3% opacity.

---

## 9. Content & Industry Voice (for Stitch copy)

Floor language, not startup landing copy.

- Prefer: "Run analysis", "Credits remaining", "Data as of", "Source", "Exchange", "Running", "Job failed — credits released"
- Avoid: "Elevate", "Unleash", "Seamless", "Next-gen", "Intelligent insights"
- Avoid fake precision and generic names — use `AAPL`, `0700.HK`, `7203.T`
- Always pair quotes with **source + timestamp**
- No emoji in UI or mock copy

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns (Banned)

- Soft mint-on-white spa/SaaS emptiness
- Gallery-airy dashboards and huge unused whitespace
- `Inter`; generic serifs in chrome
- Pure `#000000`
- Purple AI neon / glow buttons
- Second brand accent; teal or brass as primary (other style locks)
- 3 equal feature cards as default
- Centered marketing hero
- Pill clusters, emoji status, custom cursors
- Circular spinner as the only loader
- Overlapping text/image stacks; scroll-to-explore chrome
- Unscoped “realtime” claims
- Confetti, giant BUY/SELL, order tickets — research only
- Painting whole screens amber (accent starvation kills hierarchy)

---

## 11. Screen Priorities for Stitch Generation

1. **Authenticated home / analysis composer** — search, quote strip, analysts, credit estimate, amber Run CTA, dense recent jobs  
2. **Report detail** — Cool Paper reading, TOC rail, decision summary, risk footer  
3. **Tasks center** — dense status table, amber running states, failure reasons  
4. **Watchlist / stock detail** — quote-first + in-row sparks  
5. **Billing / credits** — ledger table clarity  
6. **Admin overview** — metric pit, amber only on live/action affordances  

Glance test: *With logo removed, does this still read as equity research software?* If it could be notes or generic AI chat, redesign denser and more data-forward.
